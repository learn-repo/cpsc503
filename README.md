## Welcome to my CPSC 503 Project Page

My name is Hilmi Abou-Saleh, and this is my last semester of school! During this semester I am working on implementing a mobile application that helps users become more aware of what an app can collect on them. [AppCensus](https://search.appcensus.io/) provides the base I will use for this research.

Additionally this page will contain links to my proposal and paper.
