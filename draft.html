There exists knowledge gaps between smartphone users
and  the  way  third-party  smartphone  applications  use
advertising   to   generate   revenue.   These   applications
(apps)   use   personally   identifying   information   (PII)
without  sufficient  awareness.  Such  examples  of  PII  are
hardware  identifiers  (e.g.,  IMEI,  WiFI  MAC  Address),
email addresses and sensors like the user&#8217;s location. In
order to fill these gaps we will use the AppCensus project,
which  aims  at  giving  users  better  transparency  into
how  their  mobile  applications  misuse  their  personally
identifying  information&#x00A0;[].  Over  the  last  decade  there
has  been  a  shift  in  how  revenue  gets  collected  from    users. Traditionally, users purchased an application and
   could  use  it  thenceforth.  The  last  decade,  however,
   has  seen  a  move  away  from  one-time  purchases  and
   towards recurring and advertising-led revenue. Using the
   collected personally identifying information, companies
   build  a  dossier  linking  the  user  to  various  events  and
   companies. Such examples include using location data to
   advertise local businesses, or tracking how often a user
   visits to provide them a small discount to lure them in.
   This  practice,  called  behavioral  advertising  is  lucrative
   and requires the collection of PII. Simultaneous to this
   shift  in  revenue,  the  use  of  apps  has  become  just  as
   widespread, with over one hundred billion Android apps
   downloaded in 2018&#x00A0;[]. By creating a tool that informs
   customers  about  apps  on  their  phones  we  are  able  to
   begin  raising  awareness  and  providing  transparency  in
   how these apps use their information.
   Articles on the invasive nature of apps are wide-spread.
   Mainstream                                                                news
   media  have  published  articles  discussing  how  &#8220;mobile
   apps  take  data  without  permission&#8221;  since  2012&#x00A0;[],  and
   this  has  not  slowed  down&#x00A0;[].  Due  to  the  nature  of  the
   medium,  users  are  unlikely  to  change  their  behaviour
   after reading an article. These articles do not contain a
   solution users can take. Tom&#8217;s Guide published an article
   in  late  2018&#x00A0;[]  with  the  solution  being  to  &#8220;reset  the
   advertising  ID  associated  with  your  device&#8221;.  The  New
   York  Times  published  an  article  around  the  same  time
   &#x00A0;[]  providing  a  few  suggestions  including  turning  off
   Location Services for specific applications. Many other
   articles suggested similar actions: opt out of ads, using a
   private browser, and limiting Google&#8217;s own Ad/Location
   tracking.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
These  avenues  are  great  for  raising  awareness  with
users. In 2018, the European Union released the General
Data  Protection  Regulation  (GDPR),  which  is  by  far
the  most  ambitious  and  wide-ranging  data  protection
act  yet,  with  substantial  penalties  to  corporations  that
violate  its  provision:  4%  of  worldwide  revenue.  Even
with the GDPR and by following all the newsmedia and
journalism there is still a gap in transparency.
If  we  follow  Tom&#8217;s  Guide&#8217;s  advice  to  reset  the  device
advertising  ID.  We  are  left  with  a  new  advertising  ID.
Companies,  however,  collect  more  than  one  identifier,
some  of  which  are  hard  to  reset,  or  cannot  be  reset.
Limiting  ad/location  tracking  or  turning  off  location
services  as  a  whole  is  more  effective,  users,  however,
run  into  apps  not  functioning  correctly  because  core
functionality depends on it. Disregarding malfunctioning
apps,  companies  can  use  many  identifiers  to  find  the
user&#8217;s  location.  This  includes  the  use  of  phone&#8217;s  WiFi
MAC Address and the router&#8217;s MAC Address. Through
the combination of the two addresses and the use of router
mapping  tools&#x00A0;[Skyhook]  finding  the  user&#8217;s  location
becomes  trivial.  In  summary,  the  issue  with  the  use  of
articles  to  inform  users  is  the  lack  of  transparency  and
direct solution for the user.
We  build  a  tool  to  help  inform  the  users  on  which
applications  are  misusing  their  personally  identifying
information.  By  building  a  tool  that  directly  tells  the
user  that  an  application  is  misusing  their  privacy,  we
can  influence  a  more  substantial  change  in  behaviour.
We   believe   that   this   direct   approach   will   have   an
impact because it encourages good behaviour. This direct
approach  of  helping  the  user  find  better  alternatives
is  hypothesized  to  be  successful.  In  follow-up  studies
performing user studies will provide us with a conclusive
result. Ideally the tool will suggest an alternative, equally
successful and capable application. In this ideal situation
we hypothesize this switch will have little to no impact
on  the  user.  In  these  situations  it  is  easy  for  a  user  to
switch to the alternate application. However in situations
where the alternate app is not as successful, getting the
user to transition will be a challenge. We argue that in
these  situations,  where  the  network  effect  is  working
against the target app (e.g., migrating from Facebook to
Nextdoor)  a  transition  will  be  much  more  difficult  and
require  additional  reasons  to  switch.  One  such  reason
is  the  platform  their  peers  utilize.  A  move  between
equally successful and capable apps (e.g., migrating from
Facebook to Instagram) is possible only if their peers also
use Instagram or are also making the same move.

   <!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >
   To successfully implement a tool providing transparency
   regarding personally identifying information three properties
   had to be implemented:
   <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Property 1.</span>  An easy-to-use interface that allowed users
           to quickly see the offending apps
   <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Property 2.</span>  The ability to determine offending apps on
           a per-user basis
   <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Property 3.</span>  A    list    of    information    regarding    the
           offending apps

   <!--l. 110--><p class="noindent" ><span

class="ptmb7t-">The User Interface</span>
   <a 
 id="Q1-1-0"></a>
   <!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >
   The user interface (UI) is by the far the most important
   piece.  Ensuring  that  the  users  are  able  to  find  what
   applications   are   offending,   and   the   steps   they   can
   take  to  protect  their  PII  is  paramount  to  successful
   adoption. If users spend too much time without a solution
   they  will  turn  else-where  and  use  another  app.  Two
   potential platforms were explored for the user interface:
   building  a  website  or  mobile  application.  The  website
   provides   a   cross-platform   interface   that   anyone&#8212;on
   any  device&#8212;can  use.  Additionally  the  website  would
   be  easier  to  support  and  build  as  it  would  be  using
   a  single  code-base.  However  the  website  lacked  one
   key  requirement.  It  does  not  support  <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Property  2  </span>The
   ability to determine offending apps on a per-user basis.
   Getting  this  information  from  the  browser  is  currently
   not possible, it is abstracted away for security purposes.
   The team behind AppCensus has already built a website
   that  satisfies  <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Properties  1  and  3</span>.  As  a  result  our  tools
   main goal was implementing <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Property 2 </span>and leveraging
   AppCensus&#8217;s existing website. To implement <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Property 2</span>
   we build a mobile application. We could either build this
   using a cross platform tool (e.g., Google Flutter, React
   Native)  or  build  a  native  application.  A  cross-platform
   tool would be more appealing but requires more overhead
   for  development  and  design.  Another  consequence  is
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
inability  to  satisfy  <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Property  2  </span>on  iOS.  As  a  result
building a native application written strictly for Android
was the approach we executed.

This was hinted at in the previous section &#8212; finding what
applications  a  user  has  intsalled  is  not  as  simple  as  it
might seem. As we were both targeting mobile platforms
our   options   were   iOS   and   Android.   Mobile   phone
manufacturers  are  becoming  increasingly  restrictive  to
ensure privacy and security of their users. This becomes
an issue because getting a list of all installed applications
or   a   list   of   all   running   applications   is   a   valuable
commodity. As a result iOS denies this capability to app
developers, Android does not. Our decision was simple
we would be implementing this piece on Android only.

<!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >
Collecting information about applications is not a trivial
task. Determining what applications are similar to others
requires  information  that  links  different  applications
together. Android does not provide a way to collect this
information. In order to make implement this feature an
additional piece will call an internet service that provides
information about if two apps are similar (e.g., Facebook
and  Whatsapp  are  both  in  the  social  media  category).
On  its  own  this  similarity  is  not  useful.  There  are
multiple factors in how people choose applications. As
stated earlier the network effect is important in bringing
users to the app that their peers use. Collecting all this
information requires a formal user study or existing data
source.  AppCensus  has  work  underway  to  provide  this
information.  They  have  a  database  containing  how  the
application  misused  the  users  privacy.  The  number  of
entries here is ever growing as this project continues.

   The  user  interface  was  designed  using  Sketch,  an  app
   aimed at creating high-fidelity prototypes. By spending
   time iterating on the prototype it allows us to find issues
   with  the  interface.  As  the  requirements  are  vague&#8212;we
   have a goal to build a tool that helps users understand how
   applications use their PII&#8212;the time we spend designing
   helps flesh out the kinks. While designing we are able to
   familiarize ourselves with Android Studio&#8212;our primary
   development  environment.  To  aid  in  development  and
   because  a  large  amount  of  documentation  and  libraries
   have moved over to Kotlin, we will develop our tool in
   Kotlin. Tying into the AppCensus&#8217;s database is currently
   not possible&#8212;there is an ongoing effort for AppCensus
   to provide an Application Programming Interface (API)
   that  will  allow  our  tool  to  communicate  with  their
   information.  From  a  functionality  perspective  the  app
   currently allows us to get user feedback and in the future
   gives  us  the  ability  to  iterate  into  a  production  ready
   application. <span 
class="ptmb7t-">Property 2 </span>was a complete implementation
   success. Every time the user launches the app, they are
   provided with a list of their installed applications and a
   privacy rating for each of the apps. Android provides this
   capability with a simple call, making implementing this
   part a breeze.
   The user interface is based around three primary pages:
   The overview page [Figure <a 
href="#x1-11r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:overview --></a>] which provides a high-level
   health  of  the  user&#8217;s  device.  A  list  of  all  applications

   Risk)[Figure   <a

<!--l. 167--><p class="indent" >
To measure success we applied our initial goal, to create a
tool that better equips users in today&#8217;s advertising landscape,
to the three properties discussed above:
<span 
class="ptmb7t-">Property 1.</span> An easy-to-use interface that allowed users
    to quickly see the offending apps
<span 
class="ptmb7t-">Property 2.</span> The ability to determine offending apps on
    a per-user basis
<span 
class="ptmb7t-">Property 3.</span> A    list    of    information    regarding    the
    offending apps
<!--l. 174--><p class="noindent" >
From these properties we proposed a functioning, and usable
Android application with the following abilities:
    <ul class="itemize1">
    <li class="itemize">to easily see offending applications,
    </li>
    <li class="itemize">to identify how an application is using PII, and
    </li>
    <li class="itemize">to maintain an up-to-date list of applications</li></ul>
<!--l. 181--><p class="noindent" >
To determine whether this tool is successful ideally we
would undertake a large-scale user study, we leave this as
future work. We recommend that this is done to inform
and iterate the design and development of the tool.         Using the above measures we attempt this user study in
   small-scale. To accurately represent a user we download
   applications based on popularity, not on what is contained
   in the AppCensus database. This is done by first setting
   up a phone with at least ten popular Android applications
   and games. The applications are each launched once. This
   ensures  any  additional  content  is  downloaded  and  the
   applications are functioning normally.
   We now launch our tool and compare on the above measures.
   We evaluate each attempt in the study by giving marks to
   each task on a scale out of thirty-five (35), it is broken down
   as follows:
                 <ul class="itemize1">
                 <li class="itemize">the  information  provided  is  clear  and  concise,

                 </li>
                 <li class="itemize">a usable interface, if the application crashes this
                 mark is a 0,                                                     <span

                 </li>
                 <li class="itemize">the  application&#8217;s  offences  are  clearly  marked
                 and,                                                                <span

                 </li>
                 <li class="itemize">the  list  contains  no  applications  that  the  user
                 does not have installed.                                  <span

   A mark of thirty is required for this to be considered a
   fulsome  success.  The  number  thirty  was  used  because
   we   understand   that   some   of   the   features   described
   above require AppCensus to finish developing their API.
   Without this API, providing &#8220;a relevant action&#8221; becomes
   difficult. As such we have removed five marks.
   During design a modified version is used to help reach a
   successful user experience. Functionality is not important
   during design, using only item <span 
class="ptmb7t-">(b) </span>without any weight on
   crashing and <span 
class="ptmb7t-">(c) </span>we can indicate progress through design.
   To  move  on  to  development  a  score  of  fifteen  (15)  or
   higher is required. The reason for accepting a score under
   100%  is  because  during  development  further  progress
   will be made. We anticipate that revisions will be made
   to overcome obstacles faced during development, and as
   we become comfortable with Android Studio.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
The  experiment  is  performed  during  development  and
in  preparation  for  the  conclusion  of  the  research.  To
aid  in  development  time,  AppCensus  has  provided  a
sample  data-set  that  contains  a  list  of  applications  and
the personally identifying information that are violated.
During development this experiment is carried out with
two  applications  installed,  one  with  a  limited  number
of transmitted PII, and the second with a large number
of  transmitted  PII.  The  two  extremes  in  an  attempt  to
catch  edge  cases.  After  the  end  of  development  the
experiment will be performed again, this time with over
ten  applications  installed  and  with  the  use  of  physical
phones.

   The  final  experiment  is  carried  out  five  times.  Three
   of those times are carried out on an software emulated
   device.  The  two  runs  were  carried  out  on  a  physical
   phone, the Google Nexus 6P. During each run a different
   set  of  applications  is  installed  on  the  device.  Each  is
   marked  independently.  The  marks  seen  above  are  an
   average of each run, three for the simulated experiment,
   and two for the final experiment. Changes to our tool are
   made  after  the  simulated  experiment  is  complete.  This
   allows us to iterate and improve on our final product.

   <!--l. 228--><p class="indent" >
   As  Table  <a 
href="#x1-15r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:results --></a>  shows,  each  application  has  its  offences
   clearly   marked,   and   the   list   does   not   contain   any
   application the user does not have installed. This success
   is  attributed  to  the  ease  of  implementation  and  heavy
   emphasis on <span 
class="ptmb7t-">(c) </span>from early in development. The interface
   is  designed  around  the  transmitted  identifiers  that  the
   sample data-set AppCensus provides. As table <a 
href="#x1-15r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:results --></a> 1 also
   shows, as development continues the interface becomes
   more  usable.  This  is  largely  due  to  improvements  and
   bug fixes that occur during this period. Finally, during the
   trials there was no improvement in <span 
class="ptmb7t-">(a)</span>. While information
   clarity is improving between trials, the ability to suggest
   alternative applications is not implemented. Therefore no
   additional marks can be given to that feature.

   Overall these results are successful. This is largely due to
   the success of our design and initial research. The design
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
captures the requirements of our tool, providing a usable
interface that clearly marks the application&#8217;s offences.

<!--l. 236--><p class="indent" >
The  progress  made  during  this  research  is  promising.
We believe that with further development, by testing and
iterating  on  the  current  product,  launching  AppCensus
for Android will be successful. In order to be successful
the  user  interface  should  be  iterated  upon,  including
suitable  alternatives  to  the  offending  application  and
educating the user on the harms of each identifier. The
designs  for  alternative  applications  are  present  in  our
high-fidelity prototype. After completion of AppCensus&#8217;s
API,  it  becomes  possible  to  add  these  as  functioning
pages within our tool.
Developing   for   Android   using   Android   Studio   has
steep  a  learning  curve.  Part  of  the  success  is  as  a
result  of  the  previous  experience  developing  mobile
applications.  If  our  tool  is  to  be  further  developed,  we
recommend additional time be dedicated to development.
Furthermore,  investigating  iOS  should  be  done  for  the
case  Apple  begin  to  provide  support  for  installed  or
running applications. Developing an application for both
platforms, iOS and Android, doubles the amount of work
required.  To  alleviate  this,  a  multi-platform  tool  (e.g.,
Google Flutter, React Native) is highly recommended for
development.
